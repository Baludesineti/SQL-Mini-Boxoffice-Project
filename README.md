🚀 Mini SQL Project — BoxOffice_DB (90+ SQL Queries!) 🎬📊

Over the past few days, I worked on an end-to-end SQL  project using a movie dataset called BoxOffice_DB.

 The goal of this project was to simulate real-world business analytics and extract actionable insights using advanced SQL techniques. I analyzed data related to films, budgets, collections, industries, genres, directors, OTT platforms, languages, IMDb ratings, and more—leveraging Joins, CTEs, Ranking Functions, Aggregations, and Window Functions, Store Procedures, and Virtual Tables (Views).

🎯 Key Insights & Metrics Extracted
✔ Total films released
✔ Total Budget, India Gross, Overseas, and Worldwide Collections    ✔ YOY% Growth Rate Budget, India Gross, Overseas, and Worldwide Collections
✔ First-day worldwide collections
✔ Films released by year and week
✔ OTT platform–wise movie distribution
✔ Verdict-wise, industry-wise, and language-wise film breakdowns
🧠 Advanced SQL Analysis Performed
🔹 Top 10 films by Worldwide collections
🔹 Top 10 films by India / Overseas / First-day collections
🔹 Top directors by:
Number of films released
Worldwide revenue
India gross
🔹 Top lead actors by worldwide earnings
🔹 Top-rated and lowest-rated films (IMDb)
🔹 Longest and shortest runtime movies 
🔹 YOY% Growth rate on Budget 
🔹 YOY% Growth rate on Overses Collection
🔹 Industry-wise Top 7 films
 (Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood, Mollywood, Sandalwood)
🔹 Language-wise analysis:
Budget distribution
Films released
Top 5 movies by collections
Runtime rankings
OTT platform film distribution

🔹 Genre-wise analysis:
Total collections
Runtime rankings
Film counts
🔹 Films without overseas release
🔹 Films within specific budget ranges 
🔹 Director + Genre + Language + Actor–based film mapping

🛠️ SQL Techniques Used
✅ CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
✅ DENSE_RANK() & ROW_NUMBER()
✅ INNER / LEFT / RIGHT JOIN
✅ GROUP BY & ORDER BY
✅ Window partitioning
✅ Conditional filtering 
✅ Store Procedures
✅ Virtural Tables(Views)

🎓 What I Learned
🔹 Analyzing large, real-world movie datasets
🔹 Applying ranking functions to business-driven scenarios
🔹 Writing multi-level joins across Language, Director, and Genre tables
🔹 Breaking down film performance across industries and markets
🔹 Strengthening an end-to-end SQL data analytics workflow

💡 Final Thoughts
This project significantly sharpened my SQL analytics skills, especially in window functions, CTEs, joins, and industry-wise segmentation.
It also helped me think more like a data analyst solving real business problems.

🚀 Excited to continue building more real-world SQL and analytics projects!
